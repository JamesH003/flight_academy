## Bugs

- Background images not displaying on deployed site through Heroku

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs-image-heroku.png)

    - I originally had my css code as per the screenshot above. To fix this, I contacted tutor support and was advised by a tutor to hard-code the URL. Although this isn't an ideal solution, it got the job done. I intend to revisit this when I have more time to do it properly.

- Text flowing onto next line on Samsung mobile screens

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs-samsung-mobile.jpg)
    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs-samsung-mobile2.jpg)

    - To fix this, I removed the Bootstrap display-4 class and replaced it with a custom CSS class and reduced font size.

- Line too long error in Python testing

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs-line-too-long.png)

    - To fix this, I added # noqa to the end of the line as it was a string.

- Commit messages starting with lowercase letters.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs-commit-messages.png)

    - From following along with the walkthrough Boutique Ado lessons, I followed suit with regard to my commit messages and used lowercase letters for the first few weeks of my project. Upon realising my error, I reverted to beginning my commit message with capital letters.

- Training and Voucher title text wrapping on to next line in between Bootstrap screen breakpoints.

    ![screenshot](documentation/training-ipad-bug.png)
    ![screenshot](documentation/voucher-ipad-bug.png)

    - To fix this, I created a media query in base.css to reduce the font-size to 2.7rem on screens with a max-width of 850px.


## Unfixed Bugs
