## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

<!-- ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site pages, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live pages (each of them) using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2FJamesH003.github.io%2Fflight_academy%2Findex.html

Sample HTML code validation documentation (tables are extremely helpful!):

**IMPORTANT**: Python/Jinja syntax in HTML

Python projects that use Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ variable|filter }}`
will not validate properly if you're copying/pasting into the HTML validator.

In order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to
[validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, pages that require a user to be logged-in and authenticated (CRUD functionality),
will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have
access to login to your pages.
In order to properly validate HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

## Defensive Programming

<!-- ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

## Bugs

- Background image not displaying on deployed site through Heroku

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs-image-heroku.png)

    - I originally had my css code as per the screenshot above. To fix this, I contacted tutor support and was advised by a tutor to hard-code the URL. Although this isn't an ideal solution, it got the job done. I intend to revisit this when I have more time to do it properly.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs-cloudinary-fix.png)

- Test flowing onto next line on Samsung mobile screens

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs-samsung-mobile.JPG)
    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs-samsung-mobile2.JPG)

    - To fix this, I removed the Bootstrap display-4 class and replaced it with a custom CSS class and reduced font size.

- Line too long error in Python testing

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs-line-too-long.png)

    - To fix this, I added # noqa to the end of the line as it was a string.

- Commit messages starting with lowercase letter.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug-commit-messages.png)

    - From following along with the walkthrough Boutique Ado lessons, I followed suit with regard to my commit messages and used lowercase letters for the first few weeks of my project. Upon realising my error, I reverted to beginning my commit message with capital letters.


## Unfixed Bugs

<!-- ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ -->

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.


There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
